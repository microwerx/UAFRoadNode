## 1. Creating a Value Type

A value type must be defined before any attributes or layers can be created. To create a value type select the menu icon <img src="Images/menuIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Then select the button labeled *Create Value Type*. A new page will appear. At the top of the page There will be a text box where the name ofthe value type can be entered. An error message will appear if a name is not entered. Once a name is entered a Data Type must be selected for the value type to be valid.
There are four options:
		
- INTEGER - These are any non-decimal numbers
- REAL - These are any numbers that include decimals
- TEXT - This includes any words or letterrs
- BLOB - Data for this data type include files or images, but is not currently supported by the app

Once a Value Type Name and a Data Type are entered click the submit button to create the Value Type.


## 2. Creating a Layer
	
To create a layer select the menu button <img src="Images/menuIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Select the *Create Layer Type* button. A new page will appear with text boxes for the Layer Name, Attribute, and Value Type. First enter the name of the layer, an error message will appear if you try to add the layer or attemp to add an attribute without it. Then enter the name for the attribute. An attribute is the kind of data that is going to be recorded. In order to add an attribute at least one value type must have already been defined. If there are no value types defined then an attribute cannot be made, and an error message will appear. To add a value type see *1. Creating a Value Type*. Once the attribute is named select the value type that will be associated with it. When this is done, click the *Add Attribute* button. That attribute will be added to the layer. Then the user can either add additional attributes by following the same process or click the *Add Layer Type* button to submit the the new layer.


## 3. Editing a Layer
	
###Rename a Layer
To rename a layer select the menu button <img src="Images/menuIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Then select the *Edit Layer* button. A list will appear showing the names of all the layers that have been created. Select a layeror use the search bar at the top of the screen to find the layer and then select it. A new window will appear displaying a text box. Enter the new layer name and then click the *Submit Change* button. The layer will now be displayed under its new name.

###Delete a Layer
To delete a layer select the menu button <img src="Images/menuIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Then select the *Edit Layer* button. A list will appear showing the names of all the layers that have been created. Swipe the layer name to the left. A red delete button will appear on the right side of the screen. Selecting the button will cause a pop up window to appear. It will ask if the layer and all of its associated nodes should be deleted. Clicking *OK* will delete the layer and all the nodes belonging to that layer. If *Cancel* is selected, then the layer and its nodes will not be deleted.


## 4. Searching for a Location
To search for a location, select the text bar at the top of the screen and then enter the name or the address of the location. Then click on the option listed below the search bar and the screen will now display the location that was searched for.

To have the map display your current location, select the current location button <img src="Images/locationIcon.png" width = "25"> in the bottom right corner of the screen. Your current location should now be displayed on the screen.


## 5. Adding Nodes
	
A node can be added to the map by first clicking on the pin icon <img src="Images/pinIcon.png" width = "20"> at the top right corner of the screen. A menu will appear asking you to select which layer you would like the node to be a part of. If you do not have any layers made, you will be unable to drop a node. To see how to create a layer go to section *4. Creating a Layer*. Once you have selected the layer type, click the *Select Node Type* button. A pin can now be placed by holding down in the location where it should be place. When the node is created, a new screen will appear asking for the name of the node. Enter a name for the node and then select the *Submit* button. Multiple nodes can be placed for the selected layer type. To choose a new layer click on the pin icon <img src="Images/pinIcon.png" width = "20"> and select the new layer.


## 6. Deleting Nodes
A node can be deleted in two different ways. The first is by holding your finger on the screen where the node is located for a long period of time. After the node has been pressed on a window will appear asking the user if they are sure they would like to remove the node. If *Yes* is selected, then the node will be removed from the map. If *No* is selected, the node will remain on the map and be unchanged. The second way to delete a node is by clicking on it to select it. Once it is selected, a new window will appear with a *Delete Node* button. Select the button to delete the node. The same confirmation window will appear. If *Yes* is selected, then the node will be removed from the map. If *No* is selected, the node will remain on the map and be unchanged.


## 7. Adding Node Data
To add data to a node, the node must first be selected by clicking on the node. A new window will appear. Then the user should click on the *Add Node Data* button in the menu that appears. A list of all the attributes associated with the node will be shown with a text field to the right. To add data select the text field and add the data. Once all of the data has been entered, click on the submit button on the bottom of the screen. 


## 8. Viewing Node Data
To view data associated with a given node, first select the node by clicking on it. A menu will appear with the layer name and node name, as well as three buttons. Click on the button labeled *View Node Data*. A new page will appear listing all of the data that has been entered for a given node and each attribute that it was entered for. The attribute name is displayed on the left and the associated data is displayed on the right. A timestamp of when the data was entered is also displayed.


## 9. Displaying Layers
Layers that will be displayed can be selected in two different ways. The first is by selecting the menu icon <img src="Images/menuIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Then click the *Select Layers* button. A list of all the layers will appear. Click on the buttons to the right of each layer name to choose which layers will appear on the map. Only nodes of the selected layers will appear on the map. The second way to select layers is to click on the layer icon <img src="Images/layerIcon.png" width = "25"> in the top right corner of the screen. Again, the list of layers will appear and can be selected by clicking on the button to the right of the layer name.
