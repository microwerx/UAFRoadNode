Thoughts on how you may wish to proceed, from the initial development team:

- Finish adding Import/Export of CSV/KML files
	- Currently have dummy functions

- Add cryptographic validation on imported data
	- Attributes already added to layers table

- Add Input Validation

- Add more node colors and make them user definable

- Add BLOB data type support so files, images, and videos can be attached to data

- Add an interactive tutorial

- Add ability to hide or responsibly delete unwanted value types

- add ability to delete individual data points (as opposed to a whole node)
